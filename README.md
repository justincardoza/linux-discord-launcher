# Unofficial Discord Launcher for Linux

This is a small script to keep a Discord client installation up to date on a Linux system. If you use a package manager other than `apt`, the official client 
is currently only distributed as a tarball. This script adds a step before running the client to check for and download the newest version. There are unofficial 
packages for other package managers, but it's hit-or-miss whether those are actually up to date. Going directly to the source eliminates that worry.

## How to install

Clone this repository or just download `index.js` to wherever you want to keep the launcher script. This could be where you want to install Discord, or it can 
be a separate location if you prefer. You will also need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) using your preferred method, whether that's a direct download 
or a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), which Node supports quite a few of. On [Fedora](https://getfedora.org), the command I 
used was `sudo dnf install nodejs`.

## How to use

Run the main script using `node`. It will download the client, extract it into the directory you choose, and run the main executable. You can specify a directory 
on the command line as the first argument to the script, and it will install Discord into that directory. Otherwise, if you don't specify an install directory, 
it will default to the current working directory, i.e. the one you ran the script from. This is how to specify an install directory:

`node path/to/launcher/script/index.js path/to/discord/directory`

After the first run, it will install a desktop entry in `~/.local/share/applications` for easy access under most Linux application menus. It uses the original 
`discord.desktop` file included in the Discord bundle, modified to run the launcher script in the directory used for the first run.
